This plugin creates a nice looking optin that shows a signup form of your choosing. It was created for use on [Skill Collector](https://www.skillcollector.com "Skill Collector")

== Description ==

This plugin was intended for use with a newsletter signup form. I wrote it for my personal blog and decided to share it. The effects that happen:

*	Page is greyed out
*	Colored surface (default: red) slodes in from the right
*	Form pops up

I liked the way this looked, and it has other advantages:

*	Feels less annoying than a popup (for me personally)
*	Attention is 100% on the signup form

Why this plugin?

*	It is very simple
*	It is easy to customize (you can add your own form code and CSS)

== Installation ==


1. Upload all files from https://github.com/actuallymentor/wp-slidein-popup to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Change the settings under Settings > WP Slidein Popup

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
